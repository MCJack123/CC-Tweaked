The gist program can be loaded as an API, allowing programs to easily download and upload Gists.
You must load gist with the following command:
os.loadAPI("rom/programs/http/gist.lua")
Once loaded, these are the functions that will be available:
gist.get(id)
gist.getAll(id)
gist.run(id, ...)
gist.info(id)
gist.put(files[, description[, id[, interactive]]])
gist.delete(id[, interactive])
